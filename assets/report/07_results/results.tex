\section{Results}
Firstly, the machine used for development and producing results was a 2015 15-inch Macbook Pro with a 2.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of memory, 500GB of storage and a battery cycle count of 704.

As has been mentioned, the data set used for training and testing was randomly split into a training set of 70 patients and an evaluation set of 20 patients. To run tests a script was written which would run the algorithm on the training set with 10 different sets of seeds whilst also testing the best individuals against the evaluation set. The script is available in the github repository for this project (available at \url{https://github.com/marcus-bornman/cos_710_assignment_3}). The results for the 10 test runs can be seen in table \ref{tab:test_results} while the best, average and standard deviation of the accuracy for training and accuracy for testing are summarized in table \ref{tab:classification_accuracy}.
