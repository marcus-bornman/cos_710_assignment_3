\section{Selection Method}
As per the approach that did not incorporate modularization, tournament selection \cite{miller1995genetic} was used as the selection method for all genetic operators. To expand \emph{T} individuals are selected entirely at random from the existing population. Then, from this set of individuals (ie. the \emph{tournament}) the fittest individual is selected. The size, \emph{T}, of the tournament was 48. If genetic operators required more than one individual from the existing population, the method was reapplied to select each individual.
